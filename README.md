# Corona taxi
Team project made for Algorithms and Data Structures course. Program's main objective is to bring patient to the nearest and empty hospital. To do this, the program uses a customized Dijkstra algorithm. The program is operated using a GUI where user can enter a file name, adjust the speed of the animation and add new patients. The program results in an animation (with adjustable speed) of patients transport and text records of all patient's journeys.

## Used technologies:
